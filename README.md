# Spatial-U-Net


This repository provides example speech enhancement results of the Spatial-U-Net project.

    Example_01: Input SNR = -20 dB
    Example_02: Input SNR = -25 dB
    Example_03: Input SNR = -30 dB

There are three files in each folder:

    noisy_input.wav: the speech signal before enhancement;
    enhanced_output.wav: the enhanced output;
    speech_only.wav: the clean speech received at microphone array.
